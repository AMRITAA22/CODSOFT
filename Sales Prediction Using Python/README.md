# 📈 Sales Prediction
This project predicts future sales based on historical data using supervised machine learning techniques. It addresses a real-world regression problem, where the goal is to forecast sales revenue by identifying patterns and relationships in past sales trends. Such predictive modeling is widely used in retail, finance, and supply chain domains to optimize inventory, marketing, and business strategies.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of product sales based on factors like advertising expenditure on different platforms (TV, Radio, Newspaper). This helps businesses optimize marketing budgets and maximize sales.

In this project, we aim to predict **Sales** using various advertising channels using **Linear Regression** in Python.

## 📂 Dataset

We have used the **Advertising Dataset** from Kaggle:
- [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input)

### Dataset Columns:
- `TV`: Advertising budget for TV
- `Radio`: Advertising budget for Radio
- `Newspaper`: Advertising budget for Newspaper
- `Sales`: Actual sales figures

## 🚀 Approach

1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load Dataset**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summary statistics
   - Data visualization with Pairplots and Heatmaps
4. **Data Preparation**
   - Selecting features (`TV`, `Radio`, `Newspaper`) as inputs
   - Target variable: `Sales`
   - Train-test split
5. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression Model
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - R-squared Score
   - Mean Squared Error
7. **Visualization**
   - Plotting Actual vs Predicted sales
8. **Prediction on New Data**
