# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of the **CodSoft Data Science Internship (Task 1)**. It involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, fare, and passenger class.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The objective is to build a classification model using the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, number of siblings/spouses aboard, and port of embarkation. By analyzing these variables, the model can help understand which factors contributed to survival likelihood.
