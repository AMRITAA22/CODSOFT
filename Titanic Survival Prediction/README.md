# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of the **CodSoft Data Science Internship (Task 1)**. It involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, fare, and passenger class.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Using the Titanic dataset, build a classification model that predicts whether a given passenger survived or not.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- Contains features like:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Passenger class
  - Fare
  - Number of siblings/spouses
  - Number of parents/children
  - Embarked location
  - Survival (target variable)

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Ipywidgets (for interactivity)

---

## 📊 Steps Followed

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Feature Encoding & Scaling**
4. **Train-Test Split**
5. **Model Building using Logistic Regression**
6. **Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report**
7. **Interactive Prediction UI using `ipywidgets`**

## 🎮 Interactive Section

This notebook includes an interactive section where users can:
- Enter passenger details (age, class, gender, etc.)
- Click a button to get a real-time prediction (`Survived` or `Did not survive`)

---

## 📈 Accuracy Achieved

- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy**: ~`80%`
